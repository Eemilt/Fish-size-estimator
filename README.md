# Fish-size-estimator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Ai-idea about estimating fish length or weight based on image and any available supporting information. Ai should be able to first recognize fish species and based on that, estimate either weight or length. The species of fish affects its dimensions and variation is possible even within the species. 

## Background

problems to be solved:
* Weighing the fish can damage the fish and thats why often the length is only measured.
* Sometimes equipment needed to measure the fish is not available
* App could also help the user to collect personal fishing catches to one single location


## How is it used?

The application is accessed using a smartphone. It should be possible to take normal camera pictures and import them to fish size estimator, but also there should be an option to take pictures straight in the app. During the import/analyse option bar should make it possible to include available data to that image. Images taken by the user should be used to increase the fish images database size to be even more accurate.


To make the analyzing accurate, fish images should be taken from the same angle.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data should be collected from the users. AI must be able to perform accurate analysis on the basis of available information.

## Challenges

Collecting large image database from wide variety of fishes might be difficult.

## What next?

Users could get more excited about the app if it allowed competition.
